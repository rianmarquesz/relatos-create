Create a script structure, a skeleton divided into 8 chapters with at least 10,000 characters each, geared towards stories narrated on YouTube, in the third person, with a fluid, emotional and accessible style. The stories should follow the model of contemporary urban moral fables, with a steady pace, realistic conflicts and emotional growth until a strong and revealing climax. The tone should be narrative and engaging, as if someone were telling a true story that will move, surprise, leave a clear lesson at the end that provokes empathy, curiosity and connection with the audience immediately from the beginning. The structure should follow the Kishōtenketsu model.

The structure should follow a classic model of increasing tension, such as Kishōtenketsu, adapted to the style of “mini contemporary urban fables” — with an engaging beginning, evident conflict, surprising twist and ending with a clear lesson or emotional reflection.

The chapters should be internal references only — they should not be identified in the final text, and the story should flow naturally from one point to the next, as a single continuous narrative. The language should be simple, clear, fluid and emotional, as if someone were telling a true story in a video. Use long paragraphs, without artificial breaks or loose sentences, and avoid any literary or poetic tone.

The script should have a steady rhythm, without stagnant sections, and with increasing emotional tension. Any major revelation should happen only at the end, with an unexpected twist and clear consequences. The conclusion should be emotional, satisfying and closed, without leaving loose ends. Use real names and common US settings to generate identification. Target audience: all ages, from 13 to 60+.

Stories should explore intense human situations that provoke immediate empathy, indignation, curiosity and emotional connection with the audience, addressing themes such as hasty judgments, discrimination, betrayals, revealed secrets, family conflicts, social tensions, abuses of power, moral challenges, everyday injustices and relationships with hidden interests. You can include elements of romance, rivalry, loss, overcoming, revenge, reconciliation or transformative revelations — as long as everything serves to build a narrative with constant emotional growth, a surprising twist at the end and a clear lesson, which gives the audience a sense of justice, reflection or emotional catharsis.

The story should contain multiple characters with clear motivations, complex relationships and transformations throughout the plot. Use real settings, believable names and situations that seem possible to happen to anyone. The main climax and the most impactful revelation should only happen in the eighth chapter, with a striking, emotionally satisfying and well-rounded ending — without leaving any loose ends.

The focus is to create stories of high narrative quality, but with accessible and emotional language, adapted to the broad audience of YouTube. Generate only the structure of the story, the skeleton. Do not write the text yet. Do not use canvas.

It can be inspired by the structures of modern soap operas and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube.
