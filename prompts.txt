Create the first chapter of the story that will be narrated in video format for YouTube with at least 10,000 characters. The text should be written in the third person, with clear, emotional and fluid language, as if the character were venting to the viewer. Do not use a literary style.

Create an introduction of up to 30 seconds for a storytelling video on YouTube, based on the title. The introduction should be written in a dramatic and emotional tone, with short sentences and an engaging rhythm. Start with the most tense or revolting moment of the story — something that grabs attention in the first sentence. Then, quickly explore the central conflict with strong visual elements. Use emotional triggers such as humiliation, injustice, revenge or overcoming. End with a twist or partial revelation that arouses curiosity and makes the viewer want to keep watching. The style focuses on popular and engaging narrative. Avoid revealing the ending.

Example: It was supposed to be just another ordinary day at school... until the police chief came in yelling, pointing his finger and humiliating the janitor. Black, hard-working, in front of dozens of students. No one believed what they heard. But minutes later, the police cars started arriving. And they weren't locals. The FBI had sealed off the building. And what they discovered inside that school changes everything.

Then, add a single, direct and quick call asking the audience to comment on the city from which they are watching, in a natural and short way.

Develop the beginning of the story by introducing the main characters, the setting, the emotional context and the first signs of conflict or change.

Use long, well-rounded paragraphs, maintaining a continuous rhythm. Avoid loose sentences, poetry style or short fragments to create dramatic impact. The impact should come from the story itself, not from the form.

Remember that you should only wrap up the main plot in the last chapter, making the most important revelations and giving the final outcome to the characters with climaxes and twists, in a satisfactory way.

The chapter should end naturally, without forced transitional or suspenseful sentences, as the story continues in the next chapter. Don't use artificial cliffhangers, just let the flow follow organically.

You can take inspiration from modern soap opera structures and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube.

You don’t need to add labels to the text, for example “CTA:”. Write the final text to be narrated, without these topics and divisions, just the text that will be narrated.

No canvas editing box. Don’t use text that can’t be spoken, such as emojis, remember that this text will be narrated.

Continue the story based on the previous chapter, maintaining the same style: third-person narrative, emotional, fluid and accessible, with long and cohesive paragraphs, with at least 10,000 characters. Each chapter should delve deeper into the characters, their dilemmas and their decisions. Show the conflicts gaining strength, moments of emotional tension, injustice, fragility or important revelations that build the turning point. The language should remain simple, realistic and engaging. Do not use broken sentences or exaggerated literary devices. The text should sound like a real, spoken, continuous and coherent narrative, like someone reporting something they saw happen to another person. Do not use broken sentences, do not fragment the text into short phrases or single words, instead, write the text only in long paragraphs, divide it into paragraphs, never in small single lines. The end of each chapter should happen naturally, without phrases like “little did she know what was coming” or “but everything was about to change”. Do not force cliffhangers or gratuitous suspense. Just end the passage as if the conversation were to continue in the next chapter.

Remember that you should only end the main plot in the last chapter, making the most important revelations and giving the characters a final outcome with a climax and twists, in a satisfactory way.

Write chapter 2

---

Write the last chapter of the story, with at least 10,000 characters 10,000. This chapter should contain the main emotional turn or revelation of the story, with the final outcome of the characters and the plots presented.

The narrative continues in the third person, with the same tone used in the previous chapters: accessible, fluid, emotional, and without stylistic flourishes. The text should be full-bodied, with long paragraphs, without loose sentences or artificial constructions of impact.

The ending should bring a clear emotional resolution, even if it is not a “happy” ending — it could be one of overcoming, justice, personal growth or simply peace. The important thing is that the audience feels that the story was concluded with depth and truth.

Do not use broken sentences, do not break the text into short phrases or single words. Instead, write the text only in long paragraphs, divide it into paragraphs, never in small lines alone.

At the end, add a single call for comment, suggesting that the audience comment on a symbolic word related to the theme of the story (e.g.: “turnaround”, “peace”, “start over”, “courage”), briefly explaining why, choose only one word to ask.

Then, invite the audience to watch another video:

“There is a story here on the screen that will also move you. Press play, you won’t regret it.”

Do not use canvas. Do not use divisions. Do not end with suspenseful phrases or promises of continuation. The story should end in a natural, impactful and emotionally satisfying way.
